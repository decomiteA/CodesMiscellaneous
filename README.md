# CodesMiscellaneous
This repository contains different codes for simulation and investigating reaching movements.


## Minimum jerk
This section aims at representing reaching movements using minimum jerks computations as detailed in Flash & Hogan 1986. This section contains two codes, one that is defined for straight reaching movement to a single target and the other one that representes movements to a target while going through a via point (to create a curved movements). The process used to generate the movement can be used to expand to more complex movements (for example where participants had to stop at the intermediate target). 


---> MinJerkStraightLine
     This is a Matlab script that computes hand trajectories from point A to point B using minimum jerk movements.
     
---> MinJerkViaPoint
     This is a Matlab script that computes hand trajectories from point A to point C through a via point C (where it does not has to stop)
